VSCode was used to write the project code using Code Institute template

### Libraries

#### Python Libraries
- os - used to clear terminal
- gspread - Google Sheets API wrapper
- csv - CSV file processing
- collections - Specialized container datatypes
- tertools - Functions creating iterators for efficient looping
- gspread_formatting - Google Sheets formatting
- time - used to displayed delayed messages in the terminal
- [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) - used to carry out testing on single units in validation.py file

#### Third Party Libraries
- [colorama](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used this library to add color to the terminal and enhance user experience. I marked warning/error information with color red and user feedback with blue and green
- [email_validator](https://pypi.org/project/email-validator/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used this library to validate if user email input is of the form name@</span>example.com
- [gspread](https://docs.gspread.org/en/latest/) - JUSTIFICATION: I used gspread to add and manipulate data in my Google spreadsheet and to interact with Google APIs
- [google.oauth2.service_account](https://google-auth.readthedocs.io/en/master/) - JUSTIFICATION: module used to set up the authentification needed to access the Google API and connect my Service Account with the Credentials function. A creds.json file is created with all details the API needs to access the google account. In deployment to Render this information is stored in the config var section.

### Automated Testing
<details><summary>See unit testing</summary>

- I wrote unit tests using Python unittest library
- I tested separate functions to verify correct user input:
  - validation of user email and user name input

I needed to amend the function and add 'Try Except' blocks to handle TypeError.
Initial error called - 'TypeError: object of type 'int' has no len()'


![User email unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/email-validation-test.jpg)
![User name unit test](docs/testing/unit-tests/username-validation-test.jpg)

  - validation of data in log_in_players and register_new_players

When running the test initially, there was a TypeError called - 'TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable'. I handled this error by adding 'Try Except' blocks to both functions. This resulted with passed test.

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ------- | ------- |
| When selecting 'go back to main menu' option after the game has finished, the game title was not displayed | Correct the function's indentation |
| When selecting a correct menu option after a few wrong numeric inputs the relevant game option was not called | Move the while loop at the top within the function |
| Underscores within the game title were not displayed after deployment to Render portal | Changed color settings for yellow & red |
| Gradient background color does not take up the full screen size | Add background-attachment property |
| Players names input values are not displayed in the game ‚Äì instead of name a ‚Äú‚ÄòPlayer1‚Äô‚Äôs / ‚ÄòPlayer2‚Äô‚Äôs move.‚Äù is shown | Reassign a value of player1name & player2name to the indexed-0 value (name) input by the user in ‚Äòcreate_new_players‚Äô function |
| Users input data was recorded in the same row in four columns instead of 2 separate rows | Created a list of players and while loop inside the 'register_new_players' function for Google Spreadsheet update separately for two players |
| There were quite a few errors and warnings related to exceeded number of characters in line, whitespace within a blank line, trailing white spaces or missing white spaces around operators | Split the comments or print functions into two separate rows maintaining correct indentation. Followed a guidance within pep8 online tool and corrected all warnings and errors |
